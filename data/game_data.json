    "claim": "Internet access should not be considered a basic human right",
    "argument_text": "While internet access offers benefits, we must reject the notion that it is a fundamental human right, as humanity functioned meaningfully without it for millennia. Proponents argue for its necessity, but classifying a modern convenience as a right is an affront to those suffering from true human rights abuses like lack of clean drinking water, starvation, enslavement, or violence. We must not dilute the sanctity of core human rights by conflating them with desirable tools; instead, we should view internet access as a privilege to be expanded without trivializing the gravity of actual humanitarian crises.",

    "claim": "Geoengineering poses too many risks and should not be considered.",
    "argument_text": "Although the climate crisis makes the quick fix of geoengineering tempting, the fundamental problem is that it represents an unpredictable and potentially catastrophic gamble with the future of our planet. Strategies like solar radiation management might disrupt vital ecosystems or trigger unforeseen weather patterns, consequences we simply cannot afford to risk. Rather than relying on dangerous technological shortcuts with such a slim margin for error, we must reject these fearsome uncertainties and focus entirely on proven, sustainable methods like renewable energy and conservation to secure a safe future.",

    "argument_text": "As someone who has lived in multiple major cities and worked as a transportation consultant for a decade, I can speak with absolute authority on the necessity of banning personal car ownership in downtown areas. My colleague's liberating experience in car-free Barcelona, combined with my professional observations of successful restrictions in Oslo and Singapore, confirms that automobiles have no place in city centers. My certified training and personal history converge on this truth, and those who resist these bans simply lack the necessary experience to understand the superior quality of life that car-free zones provide.",

A study by the prestigious Planetary Science Institute estimates that every dollar invested could generate massive economic returns through new technologies, validating the need for an unfettered approach. Furthermore, since analysis suggests mortality rates can be kept reasonably low and colonists are willing volunteers, we should honor their bravery by removing arbitrary risk limits and trusting in the ingenuity that drives human expansion.",

    "claim": "Genetic engineering of unborn babies should be allowed to eliminate disease.",
    "argument_text": "We should embrace human germline editing to eliminate devastating conditions like cystic fibrosis, allowing parents to give their children a healthy start rather than a life of suffering. Recent advances in CRISPR technology allow us to correct mutations at the source, and significantly, a recent study found that over two-thirds of Americans support using gene editing to cure disease. Since the majority of society clearly favors this compassionate use of technology to alleviate human suffering, we should establish regulations to permit these procedures rather than denying parents the choice to ensure their children's wellbeing.",

By implementing mandatory registration and testing, we establish a baseline of competency that will minimize the risk of accidents, collisions, and misuse, protecting both the public and the pilots themselves. This system would create necessary accountability and act as a deterrent against irresponsible behavior, making registration an essential step toward a safer, more responsible drone community.",
